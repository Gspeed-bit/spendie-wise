🚀 Exciting News! 🚀

I'm thrilled to share my latest project, Spendie Wise, a full-stack expense tracker app that I've been building and deploying! 💼💰

✨ What is Spendie Wise?
Spendie Wise is a comprehensive expense tracking application designed to help users manage their finances effectively. With Spendie Wise, users can easily track their expenses, set budgets, and gain insights into their spending habits.

🔧 Tech Stack:
For the frontend, I utilized Next.js, a powerful React framework that allows for fast and efficient development. The sleek and responsive UI was crafted using Tailwind CSS, providing a seamless user experience across devices. On the backend, I integrated Dirzzle ORM to manage our database, ensuring efficient data handling and storage.

🔑 Authentication:
To provide secure authentication for users, I integrated Clerk, a robust authentication platform. Clerk offers seamless user authentication and management, allowing users to sign in securely and access their personalized financial data.
